      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have spent way too much time on this crap. I have no idea why it didn&amp;rsquo;t work before, but it&amp;rsquo;s working now. This whole site is hanging on a thread it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious. I am begging for nothing to break when I upload this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first the issue was it constantly bringing me to localhost:1313 everytime I clicked on &amp;ldquo;very cool blog&amp;rdquo;, instead of the main page. It took forever and a lot of hard-coding but eventually it was sort of working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

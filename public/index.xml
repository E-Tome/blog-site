        <title>Comptia A&#43;</title>

        <description>very cool blog //localhost:1313/comptia-a&#43;/ -&lt;p&gt;So I recently found out the legend himself Professor Messer started uploading videos for the new CompTIA A+ exam that came out this last March. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to get this cert for a while so with me having more free time and content that I can study, I think this is the perfect time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I read the content of the old and new exam are very similar, and the videos I&amp;rsquo;ve watched from Professor Messer a while back will still be useful. My current goal will be to have it done by the end of this month, however this might change depending on how much I have to study. The official site says they recommend &amp;lsquo;9 to 12 months hands-on experience in the lab or field&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be taking it with none. That&amp;rsquo;s about it really. I&amp;rsquo;ll more than likely make another post when I receive it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Site Pain</title>

        <description>very cool blog //localhost:1313/site-pain/ -&lt;p&gt;I have spent way too much time on this crap. I have no idea why it didn&amp;rsquo;t work before, but it&amp;rsquo;s working now. This whole site is hanging on a thread it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious. I am begging for nothing to break when I upload this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first the issue was it constantly bringing me to localhost:1313 everytime I clicked on &amp;ldquo;very cool blog&amp;rdquo;, instead of the main page. It took forever and a lot of hard-coding but eventually it was sort of working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the styling just died after I uploaded another blog post. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how. I spent another few hours just trying to fix this issue. I re-did the theme, then re-installed the whole thing. Nothing. Now I just went back to an older version of the repo and by some miracle it&amp;rsquo;s working. Half of my day gone tinkering with this bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at least now it&amp;rsquo;s up and running and seems to have kept it&amp;rsquo;s styling. Welcome to edvardto.me, my online diary.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>very cool blog //localhost:1313/introduction/ -&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Edvard Tome, which you can probably tell by this site url.
I&amp;rsquo;m a computer science student studying in DCU and I absolutely love my life.
This is my first ever personal blog page, so it might look a bit messy but it functions.
Will be uploading a mix of general life updates and grind stuff.
(You can look at what tags i&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded to by clicking/pressing on the menu at the top left.)&lt;/p&gt;

  .center {

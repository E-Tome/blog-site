Hello, my name is Edvard Tome, which you can probably tell by this site url.
I'm a computer science student studying in DCU and I absolutely love my life.
This is my first ever personal blog page, so it might look a bit messy but it functions.
Will be uploading a mix of general life updates and grind stuff.

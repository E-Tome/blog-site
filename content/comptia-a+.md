So I recently found out the legend himself Professor Messer started uploading videos for the new CompTIA A+ exam that came out this last March. I've been meaning to get this cert for a while so with me having more free time and content that I can study, I think this is the perfect time.

From what I read the content of the old and new exam are very similar, and the videos I've watched from Professor Messer a while back will still be useful. My current goal will be to have it done by the end of this month, however this might change depending on how much I have to study. The official site says they recommend '9 to 12 months hands-on experience in the lab or field'. I'm going to be taking it with none. That's about it really. I'll more than likely make another post when I receive it.

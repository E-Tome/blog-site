I have spent way too much time on this crap. I have no idea why it didn't work before, but it's working now. This whole site is hanging on a thread it's hilarious. I am begging for nothing to break when I upload this.

At first the issue was it constantly bringing me to localhost:1313 everytime I clicked on "very cool blog", instead of the main page. It took forever and a lot of hard-coding but eventually it was sort of working.

Then the styling just died after I uploaded another blog post. I don't know how. I spent another few hours just trying to fix this issue. I re-did the theme, then re-installed the whole thing. Nothing. Now I just went back to an older version of the repo and by some miracle it's working. Half of my day gone tinkering with this bullshit.

But at least now it's up and running and seems to have kept it's styling. Welcome to edvardto.me, my online diary.
